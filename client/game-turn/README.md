# contour
Draw an image with SVG

Drag and drop an image to the drop area and you will see it "drawn" using SVG.

See [this blog post](https://jmperezperez.com/drawing-edges-svg/) for more information on the technique.

## Libraries/Projects used to develop this

- [Canny Edge Detector](http://canny-edge-detection.herokuapp.com/)

## TODO

- Add a slider to be able to navigate to a specific moment during the transition (something like http://codepen.io/sdras/full/JdJgrB/ or http://codepen.io/ihatetomatoes/pen/PPwqMN)
